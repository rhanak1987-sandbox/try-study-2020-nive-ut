## see below example (on) divergence test

### 1.) create example
    On branch master
    Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
    and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
      (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
    
    nothing to commit, working tree clean

### 2.) merge in local repo
    On branch master
    Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
    and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
      (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

    All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
      (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

    Changes to be committed:
            modified:   README.md

### 3.) resolution
    On branch master
